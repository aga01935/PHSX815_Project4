# PHSX815_Project4

## This is the Project 4 for the PHSX815
This code is written in python and most of the codes can be found on the folder python

There are mainly two codes


<ol>
<li> pendulum.py : Generates the time period for set number of experiments</li>
<li> analyze.py: read the measured tempearture and calcualtes the value of acclearation due to gravity </li>
</ol>
To reproduce the result one can run
-python3 python/pendulum.py -Nexp 1000 -Tmax 100 -fname result.txt

-python3 python/analyze.py--> We need to set the name of the output file from simulation here.
